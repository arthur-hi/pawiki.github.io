Greetings Commanders!

This update isn’t going to be as substantial as it hasn’t even been a month since Update 1 came out.<br>
Regardless, in that period of time there has already been a fair amount of quality improvements and urgently needed documentation has been added to the wiki.

(further documentation will be added asap)

### Additions

- Added a handler to detect missing dependencies and display a toast notification
- Added Particle System Guide! 🎉
- Added Modding Folder to Docs.
- Added Mod Development Doc.
- Added APIs Doc.

### Fixes / Other Changes

- Improved readability across multiple documents.
- Updated ‘Tools’ docs to include download links.
- Modified PTexEdit to make use of pawiki’s code blocks.
- Adjusted Margins and Padding in regards to the header element.
- Adjusted directory names:<br>Changed “Game Updates” to “Game”, “News” to “Wiki” and added “Community” for any community news/events in the future.
- Improvements have been made to how units display their weapon statistics.
- If you access the site and use the hash “game” the news page will open and only load game related news.<br>
<span class="text-secondary">
This has been added for usage with the Clean UI mod as prior to this update the outgoing link for news would show unnecessary wiki-related news.<br>Future updates could potentially include a filtering system for the website.
