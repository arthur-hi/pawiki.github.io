Greetings Commanders and welcome to pawiki!

This is a wiki for the Planetary-Annihilation community, a place for Planetary-Annihilation-related documentation from said community regarding things like unit specificications and external tools.

Significant efforts have been put into this wiki in order to make it as useful and user friendly as possible.
There will be a lot of updates to the wiki over the next few months regarding fixes and features dependant on user responses, so please share your thoughts either in the GitHub repository via the [Issues](https://github.com/asanull/pawiki.github.io/issues) tab or you can ping me over at [discord.gg/pa](https://discord.gg/pa).
