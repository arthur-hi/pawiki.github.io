Greetings Commanders!

pawiki has been out for a little under two months now and I think it's time to go over all of the recent changes.<br>
There have been quite a few additions, bugs and fixes in that short period of time so this post will be covering any of the memorable changes that have been made since initial release with the majority of these changes being made due to user feedback.

### Additions

- <b>Bugs!</b> The new Bugs Faction can now be found under the Units tab.<br>

This faction is a work in progress and many things are subject to change, the mod is currently available from the in-game mod manager and I highly recommend checking it out!

- Added dropdown to units sidebar for unit sorting.
- Added new Guides section to documents page.

- GitHub tables support, see more at [Organizing information with tables](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables)
