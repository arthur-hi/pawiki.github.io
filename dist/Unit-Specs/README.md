This directory contains the documentation related to specs found in a units Json file.<br>
It will mainly covers things affecting the units behaviour, so will not cover things such as models, effects, sounds, and icons beyond the basics.

## Unit Spec

This is the overarching spec that is essentially what is in all units json file.<br>
It contains all the info a unit needs in order to define its behaviour.

This is referenced in the Unit Spec document and should be the first document you read.<br>
It will reference the other documents listed below and show everything a unit can have.

## Other Documents

These other documents are made for each section of the unit spec I felt required more than a short reference or would be easier/more useful to reference independently.
