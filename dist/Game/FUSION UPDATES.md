Hello Commanders,

The time of the Unicorn is over, and now, the time of Fusion begins. It represents the beginning of great change.

This arc kicks off with the introduction of the Stinger, the little bot that could. Bringing anti-air back to the Bot Factory with its twin mounted homing missile pods, it can accompany your Dox raids to bring down those pesky Icarus and Bumblebees.

A major improvement to the lobby UI has been introduced, with the host being able to drag, drop and swap players. Easily switch teams around to achieve Ultimate Balanceâ„¢. There is also no longer a default system in new lobbies, saving your CPU from generating something you were probably not going to use. Just doing our bit for the planet. Lastly, asteroids can now be included in randomly generated systems.

The hand-crafted map pool has expanded, with all previous 1v1 ranked maps available. A revised default system list includes some new FFA / team maps for you to play but donâ€™t panic! PAX has survived the cull ðŸ™‚

You may have noticed the servers are running smoother than ever, with the recent upgrades to the fastest m5zn instances in all regions. Our dedicated servers for big FFA and team games have also been upgraded.

The Fusion Commander is available to all players during the Steam Summer Sale and Humble Greatest Hits Sale, after which it can be purchased through the Armory.
