Scroll to the end for latest patch notes.

Hello Commanders,

Your eyes do not deceive you, this creature of majesty above is both half-Commander and half-unicorn. Touch its horn if you will, but the only wish it grants is the pillaging of the galaxyâ€™s resources to ensure the demise of your enemies. Friendship is temporary, but a well-placed ubercannon is forever.

The Unicorn Commander is available to all players during the Steam Summer Sale, after which it can be purchased through the Armory. It also comes with its own strategic icon so that everyone else knows that youâ€™re better than them, both as a player and a person.

Lobbies now have the option to shuffle player starting locations. No longer can you know who is where without any scouting in FFA and team games. Live the mystery.

The AI has had an easy difficulty added to skirmish and normal in Galactic War as part of some more extensive changes. We hear your eyebrow lift (just one, youâ€™re classy like that) at the addition of an easier difficulty, but once improvements land and itâ€™s kicking your hiney, youâ€™ll be sorry you got all sniffy about an easy difficulty.

Translations have been updated and expanded to include community mods like Legion Expansion and Queller AI.
